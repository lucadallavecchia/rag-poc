The new Inter signing spoke to Inter TV in an interview to present himself to all of the fans.\n\n**Welcome. What does coming to a club like Inter mean for your career?**\n\n_\"For me, Inter is one of the biggest Clubs in Europe, when the opportunity to play here was presented to me, I had no doubts. I really wanted to come here, it's a great opportunity for me, I know how prestigious this Club is and what it represents and I am very happy to be here\"._\n\n**Your Coach at Dinamo Zagreb was Fabio Cannavaro, someone who knows Serie A very well. What did he tell you about the league?**\n\n_\"He spoked to me a lot about it, the League, this Club because he's played here, about Italy and Milan. We had a great chat\"._\n\n**Your characteristics make you a perfect “box to box player”, you can play on the right and left, you're extremely flexible. What do you think your best characteristics are?** _\"I don't like to talk a lot of about myself,_ _I_ _am a footballer who enjoys playing for the team,_ _I_ _want to help my teammates as much as possible, doing the what I can to the best of my abilities. I am very happy to be here,_ _I_ _can't wait to get started\"._\n\n**The midfield is the heart of Inter, it will be a great responsibility but also a chance to grow lots. What do you think you'll be able to learn from the experienced players that have been here a long time?**\n\n_\"I think I'll be able to learn lots. There's some players with lots of_ _experience_ _here, some top quality players who have played in the Champions League for years, as well as World Cup's, European Championship's, Copa America's and this all_ _confirms_ _their wealth of experience: I think they can help me lots. Personally, I can_ _improve_ _tactically, in defence and in attack. One is never perfect and_ _I_ _think that you must try to grow every day, and I will try to do_ _exactly_ _that\"._\n\n**In recent Inter history, there have been a few Croatian players who have passed through Milano and done well. Years ago, a young Kovacic and more recently, Perisic and Brozovic. Are there any characteristics that you see in them and yourself ?**\n\n_\"Certainly,_ _I_ _spoke with them before coming here. They confirmed the size of the Club, how_ _prestigious_ _it is and told me lots of_ _positive_ _things. The decision was really easily, they all wished me good luck on this new adventure\"._\n\n**The fans are fundamental for Inter. Is there something that you want to say to them to present yourself in the best possible way?**\n\n_\"I wouldn't know how to present myself, like_ _I_ _said before,_ _I_ _will try to do my best to help the team. I will give everything on the pitch,_ _I_ _will give my all for this Club. This is definitely what they can expect from me\"._\n\nNEW SIGNINGS\n\nJun 04 2025\n\n## Sučić: «Never had any doubts, Inter is one of the biggest Clubs in Europe»\n\n* * *\n\n[Italian version](https://www.inter.it/it/notizie/sucic-intervista-nuovo-giocatore-inter)\n\n[Team](https://www.inter.it/en/news/category/team) [Transfer news](https://www.inter.it/en/news/category/transfer-news)\n\n* * *\n\n## Related news\n\n[All news](https://www.inter.it/en/news/category/all)\n\n[![MILAN, ITALY - FEBRUARY 10: FC Internazionale unveils new signing Petar Sucic at Inter Headquarters (Inter HQ) on February 10, 2025 in Milan, Italy.
